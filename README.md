# WodGenerator

## Project Status
 - In development
 
## Intro
This is by no means an original idea. There are surely thousands of similiar and more advanced applications out there, but it was either this or a todo-list since the main goal of this little project is to develop my knowledge within HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

With that said, this is a Web App that generates a random WOD (Workout of the Day) that you can use when you don't have the inspiration (or plan) to come up with your own. The first version will be a simple page with a button that, onclick, will generate a random WOD based on 4 different exercises with a timecap of 20 minute, but the scope will grow as I move along.
